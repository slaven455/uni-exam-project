            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England, that plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The club has won 13 League titles, a record 13 FA Cups, two League Cups, the League Centenary Trophy, 15 FA Community Shields, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. It is also the only English club to go a 38-match league season unbeaten, receiving the nickname The Invincibles, and a special gold Premier League trophy.</p>

            <img src="/pics/invincibles.jpg">
            <h2>Highbury Stadium</h2>
            <p>Arsenal Stadium was a football stadium in Highbury, London, which was the home of Arsenal Football Club between 6 September 1913 and 7 May 2006. It was popularly known as "Highbury" due to its location and was given the affectionate nickname of the "Home of Football" by the club.</p>
            <img src="/pics/Highbury-Stadium-Home-Arsenal-1.jpg">
            <h2>Emirates Stadium</h2>
            <p>The Emirates Stadium is a football stadium in Holloway, London, England, and the home of Arsenal Football Club. With a capacity of 60,338, the Emirates is the third-largest football stadium in England after Wembley and Old Trafford.

                In 1997, Arsenal explored the possibility of relocating to a new stadium, having been denied planning permission by Islington Council to expand its home ground of Highbury. After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later they won the council's approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Arsène Wenger described this as the "biggest decision in Arsenal's history" since the board appointed Herbert Chapman. Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. Emirates Airline was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. Work was completed in 2006 at a cost of £390 million.
                
                The stadium has undergone a process of "Arsenalisation" since 2009 with the aim of restoring Arsenal's heritage and history. The ground has hosted music concerts and international fixtures featuring Brazil.</p>

            <h2>Arsenal Legends</h2>
            <h1>1.Thierry Henry</h1>
            <img src="/pics/players1/henry.jpg">
            <p>In 2008, he was voted by the Gunners' fans as being Arsenal's all-time best player. In 2009, the Daily Mail placed him as the best ever player to play for either Tottenham Hotspur or Arsenal. He featured as the best ever Arsenal player on Bleacher Report in 2011 and again in Charlie Melman's most excellent "10 Most Popular Players in Arsenal's History."

                During his eight mesmeric seasons with the Gunners, Thierry Henry won every almost domestic trophy available, and only the Champions League and League Cup were denied him while an Arsenal player. 
                
                Henry won the Premier League twice, in 2001–02 and 2003–04, the FA Cup three times, in 2002, 2003 and 2005, and the FA Community Shield twice in 2002 and 2004. In 2006 he finally got to a Champions League final with Arsenal, but lost out to Barcelona after Jens Lehman was controversially sent off.
                
                During the same seven-year period he also enjoyed great success with France on the international stage, winning the European Championships in 2000 and finishing as runner-up in the World Cup in 2006. He also played a major role in France winning the World Cup in 1998.
                
                At an individual level he won just about every trophy imaginable to add to his record of being Arsenal's top scorer of all time with 226.
                
                In short, Thierry Henry was a phenomenal player.</p>
            <h1>2.Denis Bergkamp</h1>
            <img src="/pics/players1/bergkamp.jpg"> 
            <p>Dennis Bergkamp has gone down in history of one the Club's greatest players of all time, having scored 120 goals from 423 appearances over 11 trophy-laden seasons with Arsenal.

                After joining from Inter Milan in June 1995, Bergkamp, then 26, made his Gunners debut on the opening day of the 1995/96 season - a 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough at Highbury on August 20, 1995. For the last 20 minutes of the game, after Ray Parlour was subbed, Bergkamp was the youngest player in the side.On average Bergkamp played 38.5 games a season for Arsenal (never fewer than 30) and scored 10.9 goals. He started 345 of his 423 games, and appeared in six different competitions.

                During his 11-year Arsenal career he won 10 major honours (three league titles, four FA Cups and three Charity Shields) and a host of individual awards. Chief among them were the Football Writers' Association and Professional Footballers Association Player of the Year awards in 1998, and two Premier League Goal of the Season awards.
                
                Bergkamp's Premier League record was P315 W186 D79 L50, so he took more than two points a game on average with a win rate of 59 per cent.</p>   
            <h1>3.Patrick Vieira</h1>
            <img src="/pics/players1/vieira.jpg">
            <p>Patrick Vieira came to the Premier League a relative unknown but left having redefined the role of a central midfielder.

                The Frenchman provided a rare combination of power, aggression and skill at the heart of an Arsenal midfield that won three Premier League titles.
                
                His long-range strikes and late runs into the penalty area brought 31 goals, including the one that sealed Arsenal’s Invincible season in 2003/04, the captain lifting the Premier League Trophy after an unbeaten campaign.
                
                Vieira’s spell in Arsenal was nothing short of legendary. From 1996-2005, his tenure there – were one of Arsenal’s strongest years in the League table. Vieira eventually became the club captain and won three Premier League titles and four FA Cups. With Arsenal Vieira won the Premier League titles in 1998, 2002 and 2004. He also won the Emirates FA Cup in 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2005. 2005 was the last time Arsenal won the FA Cup and to this day they remain winless there; it was only Vieira who lead them to their last title back in 2005.

            <div class="wenger">
                <h2>Arsene Wenger</h2>
                <img src="/pics/players1/Wenger.jpg">
                <p>From “Arsene Who” to “The Invincibles”, via all those things he did not see, Arsène Wenger brought a whole new lexicon to English football.

                    He also changed the way the game is viewed in England, completely altering the horizons of a largely closed-off football culture to turbo-charge its transformation into the home of the most diverse, globally respected and richest domestic league on the planet.
                    
                    Wenger’s legacy in the Premier League is beyond question and compare and will continue to be celebrated on happier occasions than this week’s anniversary of his 1,000th game at the helm.
                    
                    Across more than two decades, Wenger’s Arsenal broke records, moved homes and changed their image forever. A towering sporting erahe great visionary, Arsène Wenger, was responsible for building one of the greatest teams in the history of English football, in Arsenal’s Invincibles of 2003/04. He also accounts for one half of one of the most compelling management rivalries the game has ever seen, with his Arsenal and Sir Alex Ferguson‘s Manchester United winning every league title between 1996 and 2004. Wenger’s influence transformed Arsenal into one of Europe’s leading clubs, and the rivalry with United helped develop the Premier League into the world’s most popular league.</p>
